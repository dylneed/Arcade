# The Arcade

This is a mini-project from October 2020 meant to teach me the very basics of coding games in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I've decided to publish it to GitHub as a way of documenting my progress, and I am also a quite fond of it, despite its rudimentary implementation.

This project uses raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript and is published via GitHub Pages.
